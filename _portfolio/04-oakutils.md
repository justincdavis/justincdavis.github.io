oakutils is a library designed to provide an easy-to-use wrapper around the depthai API for the Luxonis OAK cameras. The wrappers allow a pipeline to be defined with only a few lines of code and are interoperable with the Luxonis official libraries. oakutils also bundles OpenCV compatible calibration modules, Aruco detection utilities, and a custom compiler pipeline to compile custom PyTorch model definitions onto the cameras internal processor.
