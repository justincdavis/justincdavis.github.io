<p>
trtutils is a lightweight Python library that simplifies working with TensorRT for deep learning inference. It offers a generic YOLO interface designed to provide up to a 2x end-to-end inference speedup when compared with similar Python-only inference frameworks. Additionally, it provides a unified TRTEngine class to easily load and run TensorRT engines. By managing memory usage and allocations efficiently, trtutils helps streamline deployment and ensures optimal resource utilization during model inference.
