cv2ext provides a collection of submodules allowing faster processing or ease-of-use of common OpenCV tasks via Python. For IO reading of videos or displaying images, provides a buffered and threaded implementation for each allowing up to 8x speedup compared to a serial implementation. Additionally, provides a submodule for bounding box operations with JIT compilation and provides a research submodule with various research paper implementations.
