Delivered a guest lecture on non-CPU hardware models and non-Von Neumann architectures, covering Flynnâ€™s taxonomy, including Single Instruction Single Data (SISD), Single Instruction Multiple Data (SIMD), Multiple Instruction Single Data (MISD), and Multiple Instruction Multiple Data (MIMD) models. Additionally, discussed very-long-instruction-word (VLIW) processors and field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs), highlighting their architectures, applications, and distinctions from traditional computing paradigms.
