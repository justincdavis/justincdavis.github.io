I am a PhD student in computer science at the [Colorado School of Mines](https://cs.mines.edu/) working in the HPPS lab under [Dr. Mehmet Belviranli](https://mehmet.belviranli.com/).
I previously completed my BS in computer science also at [Mines](https://cs.mines.edu/), specializing in robotics and intelligent systems.

My research interests include efficient machine learning, object detection, multi-object tracking, edge computing, and heterogeneous computing. I have worked on optimizing the performance of object detection workloads in continuous detection scenarios, specifically focusing on how multiple object detection DNNs can be utilized across multiple hardware accelerators. Throughout my PhD, I have primarily worked with NVIDIA Jetson SoCs and other edge devices, such as the Luxonis OAK and Raspberry Pi series. Additionally, my work has focused on performance modeling, energy and power draw profiling, DNN accuracy assessment, and developing heuristics for all of the above.
